------------------------------------------------------ üß† Project Summary ---------------------------------------------------
This project involves deploying a full-stack Java-based web application called VProfile on AWS using modern DevOps and cloud-native architecture. It follows a refactored approach by replacing traditional EC2-based services with managed AWS services and deploying the application using Elastic Beanstalk (PaaS) for ease and scalability.

---------------------------------------------- üöÄ Application Deployment (PaaS) ---------------------------------------------
The web application is deployed using Elastic Beanstalk, a Platform as a Service (PaaS) provided by AWS.

It handles:
Provisioning EC2 instances
Creating Auto Scaling Group & Load Balancer
Monitoring using CloudWatch

The application code is packaged as a Java WAR artifact and deployed to Tomcat via Beanstalk.



------------------------------------- üîó Backend Service Integration (Managed Services) -------------------------------------
Amazon RDS (MySQL): Stores persistent application data.

Amazon MQ (RabbitMQ): Manages message brokering between services.

Amazon ElastiCache (Memcached): Provides caching for faster access to frequent data.

These replace previous EC2-hosted services and provide scalability, high availability, automated backups, and patching.



-------------------------------------------- üåê Domain & CDN Integration ----------------------------------------------------
Amazon Route 53: Used for custom domain DNS management (e.g., vprofile.hkhinfo.xyz).

Amazon CloudFront:

Acts as a global CDN.

Caches content at edge locations for faster performance across geographies.

Integrated with HTTPS using a certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

CloudFront Distribution is linked to the Load Balancer from Beanstalk.


----------------------------------------- üß™ Artifact Creation and Delivery -------------------------------------------------
Java code was built using Maven on a local system.

The .war file was uploaded to Amazon S3.

Beanstalk fetches this artifact from S3 during deployment.



------------------------------------------------------- üîê IAM & Security ---------------------------------------------------
IAM roles and policies were configured:

Beanstalk environment role with access to S3 and other services.

Security groups were created to restrict and allow access:

App SG ‚Üí Backend SG (for DB, MQ, Cache access).

Load Balancer ‚Üí App instance.

CloudFront ‚Üí Load Balancer.



---------------------------------------------------- üìö Key Concepts Learned -----------------------------------------------
Cloud-native architecture using PaaS and Managed Services.

Use of Elastic Beanstalk for simplified deployment and scaling.

Integration of CloudFront CDN for global performance.

Domain mapping and SSL with ACM.

CI/CD basics using Maven, S3, and deployment automation.

AWS service interconnectivity and security best practices.
